    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Many people like something that is included within pop culture, that is, movies, series, books, comics, video
      games, RPG and etc. Really these things are super high, you can check it out on social media, Marvel for example
      makes a lot of money every year with its superhero movies and series, all interconnected since 2008! things that
      were famous among young people in the 80's and 90's are coming back into fashion these days, being praised in a
      lot of different media, in short it's a great time to be a nerd/geek or just like some niche of pop culture,
      because we're having a lot of news, a lot of releases, re-releases and it's even a little difficult to follow,
      that's why I want to get on the bandwagon and create a pop culture news site, with a retro design, with a space to
      discuss expectations and theories , as a forum, I believe it will be quite fun.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is young and old people who enjoy pop culture in general: video games, movies, series, music,
      books, comics and so on. People who like to be updated on the subjects of the niches they like the most within
      this pop/nerd/geek culture. Adults who enjoy nostalgia when they see things related to what they consumed when
      they were young, and young people who enjoy these retro things that are coming back. People who like to talk about
      these topics on forums and things like that.</p> <!-- change this -->

      - From Jackass to Super Mario: Directors List Everything Everywhere All At Once References - The no-nonsense way
      of talking about the film's inspirations is part of the
      director duo's charm, but they have good reason for bringing so many influences together. “We do
      this kind of thing to give each scene a specific language, so the viewer immediately thinks,
      'Okay, I know where I am,'” explains Sheinert. (Click to see more) - Stranger Things 4 stumbles, but finds
      strength in the love between protagonists - It only took a few months of tranquility, dealing with only mundane

      supporting player in Stranger Things. Even so, it is he who stars in one of the most touching
      scenes of the fourth season. With no ambitions for grandeur, no monstrous threat along the way,
      the teen shows all his courage when he heartbrokenly advises Mike (Finn Wolfhard) about his
      relationship with Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). (Click to see more) - Thor: Love and Thunder gets a new preview of

      games and the internet reacts with criticism - Last Thursday (30), Electronic Arts decided to participate in a

      If there is one point of agreement between myself and the writing team of
      Obi-Wan Kenobi (headed by Joby Harold, but also composed of Hossein Amini, Stuart Beattie,
      Hannah Friedman and Andrew Stanton), it is that the miniseries was born, by definition, like a
      hostage from Star Wars. - Barbie reveals Ryan Gosling's tanned look as Ken doll - The long-awaited and starring
