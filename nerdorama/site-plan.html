      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many people like something that is included within pop culture, that is, movies, series, books, comics, video games, RPG and etc. Really these things are super high, you can check it out on social media, Marvel for example makes a lot of money every year with its superhero movies and series, all interconnected since 2008! things that were famous among young people in the 80's and 90's are coming back into fashion these days, being praised in a lot of different media, in short it's a great time to be a nerd/geek or just like some niche of pop culture, because we're having a lot of news, a lot of releases, re-releases and it's even a little difficult to follow, that's why I want to get on the bandwagon and create a pop culture news site, with a retro design, with a space to discuss expectations and theories , as a forum, I believe it will be quite fun.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is young and old people who enjoy pop culture in general: video games, movies, series, music, books, comics and so on. People who like to be updated on the subjects of the niches they like the most within this pop/nerd/geek culture. Adults who enjoy nostalgia when they see things related to what they consumed when they were young, and young people who enjoy these retro things that are coming back. People who like to talk about these topics on forums and things like that.</p>  <!-- change this -->
